Use AODVprotocol for better routing discovery. And finding average throughput, packet sent, packet received,packet delivery ratio and average end-to-end delay also represent them through Xgraph.

During black hole attack, when packets do not receive by destination then drops the current path and finds a new path and mark the malicious nodes and restrict them from selecting them further in route discovery.
